// 10.Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to 
// each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, 
// just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence 
// describing what the program does.
// Name
var Aname = "Mudasir";
// Date
var date = "02/03/2024";
// Printing
console.log("Written some statements and used some comments\n".concat(Aname, "\n").concat(date));
